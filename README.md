# Round-about
this a code to check the last number in a series that i like to call a roundabout series. so in this series you have number lets say 18 
then if we write these in a circular order that is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,1, you may think why i wrote 1 again
because it is circular series. Ok if in this series if we start removing middle numbers that is 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 then we have
1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,1 and then we again remove middle number i.e 3,7,11,15,1 the w have 5,9,13,17,5 again we remove middle numbers i.e 
9,17 the we have 5,13,5 agin we remove middle number i.e 13 then the last number remains = 5. this was easy for a number like 18 
But if you want to find for 14762589169587416 then? so this is the code for that
